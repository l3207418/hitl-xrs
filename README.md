This repository provides the prompt templates used in *Improving Explainable Recommender Systems with Veracity-Based Human Feedback*.

We used three types of prompts in the study:

1. **Entity Extraction**  
   Used to extract relevant entities for updating the knowledge graph and addressing its potential incompleteness.

2. **Pseudo-User Study**  
   Used to simulate human feedback through LLM-generated user personas.

3. **Explanation Generation**  
   Used to generate natural language explanations from paths produced by the backbone recommendation algorithm.

All prompt files are provided in plain text format for reproducibility.
